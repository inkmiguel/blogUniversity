      <h2 class="text-primary" data-key="goal_overview">Goal Overview</h2>
      <p data-key="overview">
        When we think about what shapes a brighter future, education is almost always at the top of the list. That‚Äôs
        exactly why Quality Education is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations in
        2015. Known as SDG 4, this goal focuses on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting
        lifelong learning opportunities for all.
        But what does ‚Äúquality education‚Äù actually mean? It‚Äôs more than just putting kids in classrooms. It means that
        learning is accessible, relevant, inclusive, and empowering. It ensures that students not only attend school but
        also learn meaningful skills‚Äîcritical thinking, digital literacy, empathy, and more‚Äîthat prepare them for life
        and work in a fast-changing world.

      <h2 class="text-center mb-4" data-key="edu_title">The Education Gap: A Global Challenge</h2>
    
      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <p data-key="edu_p1">
            Even today, millions of children and youth around the world are denied this basic right. According to UNESCO,
            over 244 million children and youth are out of school. Girls, especially in low-income or conflict-affected
            areas, often face extra barriers. And even for those who do attend school, poor infrastructure, lack of trained
            teachers, or outdated resources mean they‚Äôre not learning as they should.
          </p>
          <p data-key="edu_p2">
            Education inequality is also driven by poverty, gender, disability, and geography. Rural students often don‚Äôt
            have access to schools, while urban areas may have overcrowded, underfunded classrooms. COVID-19 made things
            worse‚Äîwidening the gap between students who could access online learning and those who couldn‚Äôt.
          </p>
    
          <h3 class="mt-5" data-key="edu_why_title">Why Education Matters So Much</h3>
          <p data-key="edu_p3">
            Education opens doors. It reduces inequality, boosts economic growth, improves health, and empowers
            individuals‚Äîespecially women and marginalized communities. It‚Äôs the key to breaking cycles of poverty and
            building societies that are more just, peaceful, and sustainable.
          </p>
          <p data-key="edu_p4">
            Plus, education isn‚Äôt just for kids. Adult education, vocational training, and lifelong learning all help
            people adapt to changing times and job markets. In a world of rapid tech development and climate change, the
            ability to learn and adapt is more important than ever.
          </p>
    
          <h3 class="mt-5" data-key="edu_action_title">So What‚Äôs Being Done?</h3>
          <p data-key="edu_p5">
            Globally, governments and organizations are working to improve access to quality education. Initiatives like
            free primary schooling, gender equity in classrooms, teacher training programs, and tech-driven learning
            platforms are making a difference. But there‚Äôs still a long way to go.

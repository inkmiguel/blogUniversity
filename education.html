      <p data-key="overview">
        Education isn‚Äôt just about learning facts‚Äîit‚Äôs about unlocking opportunities. SDG 4 focuses on ensuring
        inclusive and equitable quality education for all, at every stage of life. That means tackling barriers like
        poverty, gender discrimination, and lack of access to schools or technology.
        Quality education empowers people to break the cycle of poverty, make informed decisions, and participate fully
        in society. And with digital learning on the rise, it‚Äôs more important than ever to close the digital divide and
        ensure that students everywhere can stay connected and keep learning.

      <p data-key="overview">
        Health is the foundation of everything. You can‚Äôt focus on your education or career if you're constantly battling illness or if healthcare is out of reach. SDG 3 is about making sure everyone, no matter where they live, has access to quality healthcare services. That means fighting diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria, improving mental health support, reducing maternal and infant mortality rates, and making vaccines and medicines accessible to all.
        The COVID-19 pandemic exposed major cracks in global health systems, but it also reminded us how connected we all are. If we want strong, resilient societies, health has to come first.

      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <p data-key="sdg3_intro">We hear a lot about the importance of health‚Äîbut it's easy to take it for granted until something goes wrong. That‚Äôs why Good Health and Well-Being, also known as SDG 3, is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals created by the United Nations. The mission? To ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for people of all ages, everywhere.</p>
          <p data-key="sdg3_vision">This goal isn‚Äôt just about getting people to the doctor when they‚Äôre sick‚Äîit‚Äôs about making sure everyone has the chance to live a long, healthy, and meaningful life.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-5" data-key="sdg3_divide_title">The Global Health Divide</h3>
      <p data-key="sdg3_divide_p1">Even though health is a basic human right, access to quality healthcare is still incredibly unequal. In many parts of the world, people don‚Äôt have reliable access to hospitals, doctors, clean water, or even basic medicines. In fact, over 5 million children under age five still die every year from preventable causes.</p>
      <p data-key="sdg3_divide_p2">Mental health is another silent crisis. Depression, anxiety, and suicide are on the rise globally, yet mental health services remain underfunded and stigmatized.</p>
      <p data-key="sdg3_divide_p3">Meanwhile, pandemics, pollution, poor nutrition, and lack of clean environments continue to put millions of lives at risk‚Äîespecially in low-income and marginalized communities.</p>

      <p data-key="sdg3_why_p1">Health isn‚Äôt just about surviving‚Äîit‚Äôs about thriving. When people are healthy, they can work, learn, care for their families, and contribute to society. Good health supports economic stability, educational outcomes, gender equality, and even climate resilience.</p>
      <p data-key="sdg3_why_p2">Simply put: without good health, sustainable development is impossible.</p>

      <p data-key="sdg3_final_p1">At the end of the day, health is the foundation of everything else‚Äîeducation, work, relationships, and overall well-being. SDG 3 reminds us that no one should have to suffer or die because they can‚Äôt afford treatment or don‚Äôt have access to basic healthcare.</p>
      <p data-key="sdg3_final_p2">A healthier world is a stronger, more just world. Let‚Äôs work toward one where good health isn‚Äôt a privilege‚Äîit‚Äôs a reality for everyone.</p>

These clinics bring healthcare services directly to communities, improving access to primary care and reducing preventable diseases. This model has shown success in countries like India and Kenya.</p>

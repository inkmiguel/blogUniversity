      <p data-key="overview">
        Gender equality isn’t just a women’s issue—it’s a human issue. SDG 5 is all about ending discrimination,
        violence, and unequal treatment based on gender. That means standing up for equal rights in education, the
        workplace, healthcare, politics, and at home. It also means ensuring access to reproductive health services and
        tackling harmful practices like child marriage and gender-based violence.
        When women and girls are given the same opportunities as men and boys, everyone benefits. Societies are more
        peaceful, economies are stronger, and future generations are healthier and better educated.

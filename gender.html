      <p data-key="overview">
        Gender equality isn‚Äôt just a women‚Äôs issue‚Äîit‚Äôs a human issue. SDG 5 is all about ending discrimination,
        violence, and unequal treatment based on gender. That means standing up for equal rights in education, the
        workplace, healthcare, politics, and at home. It also means ensuring access to reproductive health services and
        tackling harmful practices like child marriage and gender-based violence.
        When women and girls are given the same opportunities as men and boys, everyone benefits. Societies are more
        peaceful, economies are stronger, and future generations are healthier and better educated.

            Imagine a world where your gender doesn‚Äôt limit your choices, safety, or opportunities.

          <p data-key="sdg5_reality1">We‚Äôve made progress, sure‚Äîbut the reality is, there‚Äôs still a long way to go.</p>
          <ul>
            <li data-key="sdg5_stat1">One in three women worldwide has experienced physical or sexual violence.</li>
            <li data-key="sdg5_stat2">Girls in many parts of the world are still denied the right to education.</li>
            <li data-key="sdg5_stat3">Women earn less than men globally, with the gender pay gap averaging around 20%.</li>
            <li data-key="sdg5_stat4">In politics, only about 26% of national parliamentarians are women.</li>
            <li data-key="sdg5_stat5">Rigid gender norms hurt men and boys too, pressuring them into toxic ideals of masculinity and emotional suppression.</li>
          </ul>
    
          <h3 class="mt-5" data-key="sdg5_why_title">Why Gender Equality Matters</h3>
          <p data-key="sdg5_why1">
            Here‚Äôs the thing: when women and girls thrive, everyone thrives. Gender equality fuels progress in health, education, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. It boosts productivity, increases peace and stability, and helps lift entire communities out of poverty.
          </p>
          <p data-key="sdg5_why2">
            When girls are educated, they marry later, have healthier families, and earn more. When women are in leadership, governments are more inclusive. When all people‚Äîregardless of gender‚Äîcan express themselves freely and equally, society as a whole becomes more just and resilient.
          </p>
    
          <h3 class="mt-5" data-key="sdg5_whats_done">What‚Äôs Being Done?</h3>
          <p data-key="sdg5_done1">
            Globally, countries are passing laws to protect against gender-based violence, increase access to education, and promote women‚Äôs leadership. Organizations like UN Women, Malala Fund, and Girls Not Brides are leading the charge.
          </p>
          <p data-key="sdg5_done2">
            On the ground, grassroots movements are challenging norms, empowering women, and demanding change. And young people‚Äîespecially Gen Z‚Äîare using their voices to break cycles of silence and speak out for justice and equality.
          </p>
    
          <h3 class="mt-5" data-key="sdg5_how_to_help">What You Can Do</h3>
          <ul>
            <li data-key="sdg5_help1">Call out sexism and bias‚Äîwhether in conversations, media, or systems</li>
            <li data-key="sdg5_help2">Support women-owned businesses and female-led projects</li>
            <li data-key="sdg5_help3">Educate yourself about gender issues in your own community and around the world</li>
            <li data-key="sdg5_help4">Advocate for inclusive policies in school, work, and government</li>
            <li data-key="sdg5_help5">Listen to and amplify marginalized voices</li>
          </ul>
          <p data-key="sdg5_closing1">Equality starts with awareness‚Äîand grows with action.</p>
    
          <h3 class="mt-5" data-key="sdg5_final_title">Final Thoughts</h3>
          <p data-key="sdg5_final1">
            Gender equality isn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs issue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a human rights issue, a social justice issue, and a global development issue. When we fight for a world where everyone, regardless of gender, has equal rights and opportunities‚Äîwe‚Äôre building a better future for all of us.
          </p>
          <p data-key="sdg5_final2">Let‚Äôs be the generation that makes gender equality not just a goal, but a reality.</p>
